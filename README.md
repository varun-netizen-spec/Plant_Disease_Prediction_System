# 🌿 Plant Disease Detection System

This project is an AI-based 🌱 **Plant Disease Detection System** developed during a internship at **Elevate Labs** by **Varun Varma M**. It leverages deep learning and computer vision to classify plant leaf diseases, aiding sustainable agriculture 🌾.

## 📂 Project Overview

The system is a web application built using **Streamlit** that allows users to upload 🌿 images of plant leaves. A pre-trained **CNN (Convolutional Neural Network)** model analyzes the image and predicts the type of disease affecting the plant.

## 📊 Dataset

- **Plant Village Dataset** 📸
- 50,000+ labeled images of healthy and diseased plant leaves
- Covers multiple crops and disease types

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

- 🐍 Python  
- 📦 Streamlit – Web app UI  
- 🎥 OpenCV (cv2) – Image preprocessing  
- 🧠 TensorFlow & Keras – Deep learning model  
- 🔢 NumPy, Pandas – Data manipulation  
- 📈 Matplotlib – Visualizations  

## ✅ Features

- Upload and analyze plant leaf images  
- Detect multiple plant diseases with high accuracy  
- Simple and intuitive real-time web interface  

## 📈 Model Evaluation Metrics

- **Loss**: Measures prediction error  
- **Accuracy**: Correct predictions ratio  
- **Precision**: Validity of positive predictions  
- **Recall**: Model’s ability to find all positives  

Together, these metrics ensure the model is reliable and accurate for real-world agricultural use.
